# StudyBuddies

StudyBuddies is a frontend-only react app built using the [Material UI component library](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/).

Instead of using a database, the app is backed by in-memory mock data. If you refresh your browser, any message threads you've started will be lost. 

## First-time setup 
StudyBuddies was built using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, and so needs `Node.js` and `npm` to run locally. 

Install the app's dependencies: 
```
$ npm install
```

Run locally: 
```
$ npm start
```

Build for deployment: 
```
$ npm run build
```
